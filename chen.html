                <p>Forces an enemy unit to move slower and for allies to attack it more quickly. <br>

                <h3>Holy Persuasion</h3>
                    <p>Chen takes control of an enemy or neutral creep and receives gold equal to its bounty. <br>
                        If the persuaded creep's base health is naturally below the health minimum, its base health will be raised <br>
                        to the health minimum. Converted creeps will have increased movement speed and bonus damage.</p>

                <p>Passively provides an aura that grants increased health regeneration. <br>
                    Can be cast on allies to provide them with bonus armor and increasing the healing they receive. <br>

                    If cast on Chen, all units controlled by Chen will be teleported to him. <br>
                    Taking damage from enemy heroes or their units will cancel the teleport.</p>

                <p>Heals all allied heroes on the map as well as all units under Chen's control. <br>
                    A large heal is applied at first and a slow heal over time is applied for 8 seconds afterwards.</p>
